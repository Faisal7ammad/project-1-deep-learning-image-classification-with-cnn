# Project I | Deep Learning: Image Classification with CNN

**Group Members**

   - Faisal Hammad
   - Loz Rigby

## Task Description

We built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories/classes.

## Dataset selected

1. The dataset selected was the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It c can be downloaded [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).


## Deliverables contained

1. **Project Notebook**
   - Containing the model implementation and training process.

2. **Report**
   - A notebook report documenting the approach, results, and analysis.

3. **Presentation Powerpoint**
   - The powerpoint used during the project presentation

4. **Additional files for deployment**
    - app.py
    - Requirements

5. **Test_random_cifar10_images**
   - A data folder with 9 images to test the deployed model/app
